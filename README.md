# 30 Days Till Hell

How to get to the Build:

Not yet. I got to fix some errors that only occur in the Build.

But if you want to play it in the Editor u can do it by doing as follow:

Step 1. Go to the Unity site and download UnityHub 2020.1.6f1. 

Step 2. Download this Git and add this as a new project. Remember where u downloaded this on your PC. 

Step 3. You are ready to go.
